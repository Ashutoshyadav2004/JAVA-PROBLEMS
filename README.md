# JAVA_PROBLEMS

This repository contains various Java programs for different problems.

## Files

- `hello.java`: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!".
- `Average.java`: A program to calculate the average of three numbers.
- `addition.java`: A program to add two numbers.
- `Factorial.java`: A program to calculate the factorial of a number.

AS I WAS TRYING TO COMPILE MY JAVA PROBLEMS I GET TO LEARN THAT WHEN I USE JAVAC TO COMPILE MY PROGRAMME IT CREATES .class FILE IN THE SAME DIRECTORY (IT IS MY SOURCE FILE EX- addition.class and hello.class).

NOW WHAT I WILL BE DOING HERE IS, I WILL TRY TO SOLVE MY FIRST SET OF BASIC PROBLEMS TO GET READY FOR THE DATASTRUCTURES AND ALGORITHIMS.
LETS START THE JOURNEY FOR MY BASIC PROBLEM SOLVING LEARNING-------
Day 1.
1. Even_Odd
